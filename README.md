## Mini Project 9 :page_facing_up: 

## :ballot_box_with_check: Requirements
* Set up a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook (e.g., Google Colab)</br>
* Perform data manipulation tasks on a sample dataset</br>

## :ballot_box_with_check: To-do List
* __Learn how to work with Rust__: To learn the concept of cloud-hosted notebooks and their application in data management.</br>

## :ballot_box_with_check: Dataset
`titanics.csv`
  - This dataset contains a list of passengers aboard the Titanic in 1912, including information on those who survived and those who did not. There are 891 samples with 14 different variables. In this repository, we will visualize the age of passengers in different classes using box plots.</br>
